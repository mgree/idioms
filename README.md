# [idioms][]

Trying to find idioms in straight-line, assembly like code. Inspired
by a summer of trouble and narrowly averted disaster writing G-Code.

Implemented basic N-gram analysis, never got to G-code.

# TODO

Collect G-code samples
Something for reading G-Code lines
Various 'abstracters' for each G-Code line
